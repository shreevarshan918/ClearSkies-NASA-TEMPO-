Integrating NASA TEMPO data with ground measurements and cloude services for hyper-local air quality forcasting.

  # ClearSkies: A Humanitarian Call to Action
  ## NASA TEMPO Air Quality Monitoring Hackathon Submission
 ### Our Purpose: Protecting the Vulnerable
Every year, millions of people—especially children, the elderly, and those with existing health issues—suffer because they don't know when the air will be dangerous. Our mission with ClearSkies is simple: to transform complex satellite data into a clear, immediate warning that anyone can understand, allowing families to take action and stay safe.
 
   The Lifeline: See the Live App
This is the tool we built to give people back control over their health. It is a working prototype dashboard.

 Our Method: Blending Data to Save Lives
We had to bring together three different sources of information to create a truly protective forecast. This blend gives us the full picture, from the massive sweep of the satellite to the air a child is breathing right now.
| Data Layer           |     Source           |         The Human Value |
| 1. NASA TEMPO        |   Satellite NO2      | Seeing the Threat: Shows us where invisible pollution clouds are moving across entire regions—the large-scale incoming danger. |
| 2. Ground Stations   |          PM(2.5)       | Measuring the Impact: Gives us the exact number for the deadliest pollutant at street level, which enters the bloodstream. |
| 3. Weather           |       Wind Speed     | Predicting the Danger Zone: Helps us anticipate where that pollution will be pushed in the next few hours, giving families time to prepare. |

 The Forecasting Logic
Our simple formula proves that blending these three inputs results in a better prediction of the Air Quality Index (AQI). This logic is ready to be scaled up to protect all of North America.

 
 Our Core Humanitarian Features
->The Clear Warning: We don't just show a confusing number. We deliver an Actionable Health Notification—a simple, color-coded message (like "High Risk: Sensitive Groups Must Remain Indoors") that saves a parent from guessing.
->Hyper-Local Focus: The map shows the forecast in a small, street-by-street grid. This is about ensuring a child's school or an elderly person's home is individually monitored.
->An Honest Start: We successfully used the complex NASA TEMPO data by finding a smart way to read it (details in TEMPO_Extraction_Notes.txt). We built this simple prototype quickly so the life-saving concept could be demonstrated immediately.
